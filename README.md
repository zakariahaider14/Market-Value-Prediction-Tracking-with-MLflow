# Market-Value-Prediction-Tracking-with-MLflow
This project implements a comprehensive player market value prediction system using XGBoost Regressor. The project uses football/soccer player data to predict player market values. We integrate MLflow for experiment tracking, PostgreSQL for metadata storage, and Amazon S3 for artifact storage.
This project demonstrates a complete MLOps pipeline for player market value prediction, incorporating comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis, feature engineering and selection, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and experiment tracking using MLflow. It also includes model versioning and a deployment pipeline, providing a scalable and maintainable solution for predicting player market values while following MLOps best practices.
